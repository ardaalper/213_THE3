# 213_THE3
This was the final project of the data structures course. I used graph and hash table data structures. At the graph part of
the project, I alos learnt some algorithms like shortest path, BFS etc. The hash table part was easier than others, I just
get the ideo of hash table. However, last part of the project was bit comlicated, thats why I couldnt finish this part, but only
few functions.
